# Project Zomboid Mod - Everything Weighs Nothing #

Tested on Build 41.78.16.

This mod reduces the weight/encumberance of every item to 0.0.
Items with things inside them like water bottles and propane will still have weight, but the base weight is still reduced to 0.0, so it will be much lighter.
